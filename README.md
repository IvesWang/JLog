"# JLog" 

At begin,I want to use annotation processor+custom lint to make it more intelligent, simplified the caller's parameters, but value is unable to get to the variable name, also unable to get the length of the list during compile time, no way, had to use such a stupid plan.

本想用注解+lint来做得更智能一点，简化调用方的传参，但编译期是无法取到传值的变量名，也无法取到列表的长度，没办法，只好用这么一个矬的方案了。
